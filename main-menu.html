    <p>Hi. I'm Leo Asness. Here, I have coded some familiar games for you to play.
        Try to get the highest score, even though scores of different players are only saved across
        a single computer. Why? Because I just started coding recently, and you can't force me to
        make this that complicated when it wasn't part of the instructions.</p>

                            than the target number. You win the game if you can succesfully guess
                            the number within 10 tries. You lose if you get it wrong 10 times.</td>
